- [Face Detection](#face-detection)
- [Face Mesh](#face-mesh)
- [Finger Counting](#finger-counting)
- [Hand Tracking](#hand-tracking)

## Road Line Detection

This project focuses on detecting lane lines in video footage using image processing techniques. The implementation utilizes the Canny edge detection algorithm and Hough Transform to identify lines in a specified region of interest.

### Features
- Canny edge detection for edge extraction.
- Region of interest masking to focus on relevant areas.
- Hough Transform for line detection.

### Usage
Run the Python script to process a video file and visualize lane detection results.

## Face Detection

This project implements a face detection system that identifies and marks faces in real-time using Haar cascades. It captures video input and processes each frame to detect faces, drawing bounding boxes around detected faces.

### Features
- Real-time face detection using Haar cascades.
- Video processing capabilities.

### Usage
Run the script to initiate face detection on your webcam or a video file.

## Face Mesh

This project employs MediaPipe's Face Mesh solution to extract facial landmarks and create a mesh overlay on detected faces. It highlights key facial features, providing a visual representation of the face structure.

### Features
- Detection of facial landmarks using MediaPipe.
- Drawing of a mesh overlay on faces.

### Usage
Run the script to visualize facial landmarks on video input from your webcam or a video file.

## Finger Counting

This project counts the number of fingers raised by the user in real-time using hand tracking techniques. It leverages MediaPipe's Hands module to identify key points on the hand and determine the number of fingers extended.

### Features
- Real-time finger counting using hand tracking.
- Visualization of the number of fingers raised.

### Usage
Run the script to start counting fingers using your webcam.

## Hand Tracking

This project utilizes MediaPipe's Hand Tracking solution to detect and track hand movements. It provides real-time feedback by drawing hand landmarks on the video feed.

### Features
- Real-time hand tracking and landmark visualization.
- Supports multiple hand detection.

### Usage
Run the script to visualize hand tracking on your webcam or a video file.

## Requirements
